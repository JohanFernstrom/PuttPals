# ToggleBoys Ligan 2025 - Rules

## Basic Rules

1. Players compete in discgolf rounds at various courses
2. A round is valid when at least 3 players participate
3. Each player's score is recorded for each round
4. Lower scores are better (fewer throws)
5. Points are calculated based on performance

## Point System

### How Points Are Calculated

Points are awarded for each course based on a player's best three scores at that course:

1. For each position (1st, 2nd, 3rd best score), players are ranked against each other
2. Points are awarded at each position as follows:
   - 1st place: 3 points
   - 2nd place: 2 points
   - 3rd place: 1 point
   - 4th place and below: 0 points
3. In case of a tie, all tied players receive the same points
4. A player can earn a maximum of 9 points per course (if they have the best score in all three positions)

### Example

For a specific course, looking at players' best scores:

1. **Best scores**:
   - Johan: 36 throws
   - Jimmie: 36 throws
   - Marcus: 38 throws

   Points: Johan and Jimmie both get 3 points (tied for 1st), Marcus gets 1 point (3rd place)

2. **Second-best scores**:
   - Johan: 37 throws
   - Jimmie: 38 throws
   - Marcus: 39 throws

   Points: Johan gets 3 points (1st), Jimmie gets 2 points (2nd), Marcus gets 1 point (3rd)

3. **Third-best scores**:
   - Johan: 38 throws
   - Jimmie: 38 throws
   - Marcus: 40 throws

   Points: Johan and Jimmie both get 3 points (tied for 1st), Marcus gets 1 point (3rd)

**Total course points**:
- Johan: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 points
- Jimmie: 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 points
- Marcus: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 points

## Season Ranking

1. A player's total points across all courses determine their ranking
2. The player with the highest total points wins the season
3. In case of a tie in total points, the player with the most first-place finishes wins
4. If still tied, the player with the most second-place finishes wins, and so on
